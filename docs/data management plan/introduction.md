# 1. Introduction

Victoria's diverse culture is continually growing, with many migrants adding to its vibrant community. Data from 2017-2018 shows that while many migrants make Victoria their home, around 11,000 non-English speaking newcomers still struggle with the language, even after attending government-provided English classes. This language barrier limits their ability to access services and connect with locals. To address this, our Data Management Plan will focus on using key locations, such as restaurants, grocery stores, and pharmacies, as interaction points. By gathering and analyzing data from these places, we aim to create strategies that help migrants better understand and integrate into Victorian society.

# 2. Open Data Source

In our pursuit to facilitate better integration of migrants in Victoria, especially Melbourne, we have identified key open data sources that provide valuable insights. Firstly, data related to 'Landmarks and places of interest' can offer migrants familiarization points and places where they can engage in cultural and recreational activities, thereby easing their transition. Secondly, the 'Business establishments location and industry classification' data gives us insights into local commerce, where migrants can find products reminiscent of their home countries. Lastly, data pertaining to 'Café, restaurant, and bistro seats' paints a picture of the city's culinary and social hubs. These establishments often serve as informal community centers where migrants can practice language skills, familiarize themselves with local customs, and create meaningful connections. By leveraging these open data sources, we aim to create a comprehensive roadmap for migrants in Melbourne, ensuring they can seamlessly weave themselves into the fabric of the city.

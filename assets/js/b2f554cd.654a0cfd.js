They make temporary visits to Melbourne for the purpose of looking after their grandchildren. With 30% of Australia\'s population originating from overseas, a minimum of 4,500 grandparents are undertaking regular brief trips to aid their families. These grandparents face challenges adapting to new environments due to language barrier and cultural shock, resulting in a tendency to remain at home. Frequently, they experience loneliness and are socially isolated, especially when their grandchildren are in school or during the early stages of their stay in Australia.\\n\\nThe impact of social isolation is detrimental to the well-being of grandparents, causing stress among family members and diminishing the multicultural fabric of Australian society. Given Melbourne\'s being a metropolitan city of diverse cultures with a significant number of grandparents, there is a dire need to facilitate connections between \u201cFlying Grannies\u201d and the broader community. \\n\\nHow might we mitigate the social isolation experienced by \\"Flying Grannies\\" in Melbourne and assist them in adapting to their new surroundings?\\n\\n## Persona\\n\\n| Attribute            | Details                                                                                                                  |\\n| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\\n| Name                 | Dalin Yu                                                                                                                 |\\n| Major Responsibility | Grandpa                                                                                   |\\n| Demographics         | 62 years old, Married with children and grandchildren, Non-proficient in English, Recently moved from China to Australia |\\n| Motivations          | \\"Dalin wants to provide dedicated care for his grandson, ensuring his son able to work with peace of mind.\\"         |\\n| Motivations          | He would embark on monthly travels with his friends if he feels less overwhelmed.                                      |\\n| Pain point 1          | Dalin is not familiar with any local activities and finds it difficult to navigate around the Melbourne city.            |\\n| Pain point 2          | Social isolation due to language hurdles and the challenges of adapting to a new local culture                           |\\n\\n## Target Audience\\n\\nGrandparents aged between 50 and 65 who make temporary visits to Melbourne for childcare purposes.

Introduction","description":"Victoria\'s diverse culture is continually growing, with many migrants adding to its vibrant community. Data from 2017-2018 shows that while many migrants make Victoria their home, around 11,000 non-English speaking newcomers still struggle with the language, even after attending government-provided English classes. This language barrier limits their ability to access services and connect with locals. To address this, our Data Management Plan will focus on using key locations, such as restaurants, grocery stores, and pharmacies, as interaction points. By gathering and analyzing data from these places, we aim to create strategies that help migrants better understand and integrate into Victorian society.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"data-management-plan/iteration-1":{"id":"data-management-plan/iteration-1","title":"Iteration 1 - Cultural Navigation based on Itinerary","description":"Data Analytics and Storage","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"data-management-plan/iteration-2":{"id":"data-management-plan/iteration-2","title":"Iteration 2 - History and Safety","description":"In the second iteration of our project, the primary objective is to enhance the user experience by offering features that allow users to track, review, and share their travel routes. This iteration is designed to make the cultural navigation process more personalized and interactive. By introducing functionalities like travel route history review, scheduling, real-time tracking, and route sharing, we aim to create a platform where users can not only navigate through the city but also share their experiences and learn from others.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"data-management-plan/iteration-3":{"id":"data-management-plan/iteration-3","title":"Iteration 3 - Recommendations and Challenges","description":"In iteration 3, significant enhancements were made to augment user interaction and engagement within the application.

Think of routing as the unseen conductor of an orchestra, seamlessly guiding users through different sections of an app, ensuring smooth transitions, efficient data passage, and intuitive backtracking. It\'s the backbone of navigation, shaping how users interact with the application\'s features and content. Without effective routing, even the most feature-rich applications can become unnavigable mazes, diminishing user engagement and satisfaction. Thus, for any application to be truly user-centric, a robust and efficient routing mechanism is indispensable.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"frontend/session":{"id":"frontend/session","title":"Session Management","description":"Session management is a cornerstone of ensuring a seamless and secure user experience in React Native applications. As mobile apps frequently interact with backend services and APIs, maintaining a secure and persistent session is crucial. Without proper session management, users might encounter unexpected logouts, or, even worse, their data could be exposed to security breaches. By leveraging JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for some of our API accesses, we provide a stateless, server-side solution that ensures data integrity and authenticity between the client and server. JWTs are compact, self-contained, and can securely transmit information between parties. Thus, by adopting JWTs in our React Native app, we not only enhance the application\'s security but also optimize its performance, reducing the need for continuous server queries about user status.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"frontend/styling":{"id":"frontend/styling","title":"Styling","description":"Theme Colors","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"Introduction","description":"- Backend: Explores system operations, from running and testing to deployment and developer actions.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);

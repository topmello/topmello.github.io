They make temporary visits to Melbourne for the purpose of looking after their grandchildren. With 30% of Australia's population originating from overseas, a minimum of 4,500 grandparents are undertaking regular brief trips to aid their families. These grandparents face challenges adapting to new environments due to language barrier and cultural shock, resulting in a tendency to remain at home. Frequently, they experience loneliness and are socially isolated, especially when their grandchildren are in school or during the early stages of their stay in Australia.</p><p>The impact of social isolation is detrimental to the well-being of grandparents, causing stress among family members and diminishing the multicultural fabric of Australian society. Given Melbourne's being a metropolitan city of diverse cultures with a significant number of grandparents, there is a dire need to facilitate connections between “Flying Grannies” and the broader community. </p><p>How might we mitigate the social isolation experienced by "Flying Grannies" in Melbourne and assist them in adapting to their new surroundings?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="persona">Persona<a href="#persona" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Persona" title="Direct link to Persona">​</a></h2><table><thead><tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Details</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Name</td><td>Dalin Yu</td></tr><tr><td>Major Responsibility</td><td>Grandpa</td></tr><tr><td>Demographics</td><td>62 years old, Married with children and grandchildren, Non-proficient in English, Recently moved from China to Australia</td></tr><tr><td>Motivations</td><td>"Dalin wants to provide dedicated care for his grandson, ensuring his son able to work with peace of mind."</td></tr><tr><td>Motivations</td><td>He would embark on monthly travels with his friends if he feels less overwhelmed.</td></tr><tr><td>Pain point 1</td><td>Dalin is not familiar with any local activities and finds it difficult to navigate around the Melbourne city.</td></tr><tr><td>Pain point 2</td><td>Social isolation due to language hurdles and the challenges of adapting to a new local culture</td></tr></tbody></table>]]></content>

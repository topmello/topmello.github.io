# Overview

## Product Description

Settle Aid is a mobile application designed to assist grandparents who temporarily visit Melbourne to care for their grandchildren (also known as "Flying Grannies"). The application aims to help them seamlessly adapt to the new surroundings, navigate the city, learn Australian norms, and connect with both their cultural and local Australian communities.

## Background

"Flying Grannies" in Australia often find themselves challenged by adapting to a new culture when they visit Melbourne to care for their grandchildren. There are at least 4,500 grandparents who frequently embark on short trips back and forth to Australia to support their families. These grandparents encounter difficulties in acclimating to unfamiliar environments due to language barriers and cultural differences, which can lead to them tending to stay home. This often results in feelings of loneliness and a sense of being disconnected from the broader community, particularly when their grandchildren are in school or during the initial stages of their stay in Australia. 

The consequences of this cultural and social disconnection can be detrimental not only to the well-being of these grandparents but also to family dynamics and the rich multicultural tapestry of Australian society. Given Melbourne's status as a diverse metropolitan city with a substantial population of grandparents facing these challenges, there is an urgent need to foster connections between "Flying Grannies" and the wider community. 

## Aim 

The application addresses the language and cultural barriers faced by these "Flying Grannies," fostering a sense of belonging and social cohesion. By providing navigation support, educational resources, and community connections, it enhances their experience and integration into Australian society.

## Target Audience

Grandparents aged between 50 and 65 who make temporary visits to Melbourne for childcare purposes. This demographic demonstrates a higher proficiency in using smartphones compared to individuals aged 65 and above. They also show higher tendency to travel and adapt to different culture.


## Importance

Settle Aid is important for both "Flying Grannies" and Australian society as it improves the well-being of these grandparents, strengthens family dynamics, and enriches the multicultural fabric of Australian society.
